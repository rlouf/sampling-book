# The Sampling Book Project

This is a series of tutorials on sampling algorithms built with the [Blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) library. We aim to help beginners understand the mechanisms behind the samplers they commonly use, and provide comparisons between algorithms for the more advanced users.
